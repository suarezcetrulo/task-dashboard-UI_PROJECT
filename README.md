# Task Management Dashboard

## üìã Challenge

This project aims to build a Task Management Dashboard that allows users to view, create, update, and manage tasks in real-time. The application leverages a modern tech stack to provide a seamless and responsive user interface, along with real-time updates via Socket.io for a dynamic user experience.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Socket.io-client, CSS (Flexbox/Grid), HTML
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose)
- **Tools & Libraries:** Axios for HTTP requests, React Hooks (useState, useEffect), state management

## üßë‚Äçüíª Basic Approach

1. **Setting Up the Database**
   - **Database Choice:** Chose MongoDB for its flexibility and scalability.
   - **Setup:** Created a MongoDB database with collections for tasks. Used Mongoose for object modeling and to interact with the database.
   - **Roadblock:** Encountered issues with MongoDB connection timeout.
   - **Solution:** Optimized connection string and network settings to ensure a stable connection.

2. **Backend Development**
   - **Server Setup:** Set up a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests and serve the application.
   - **API Development:** Built RESTful API endpoints for task creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
   - **Real-Time Updates:** Integrated Socket.io on the server side to handle real-time communication and push updates to clients.
   - **Roadblock:** Difficulty in managing real-time updates without causing memory leaks.
   - **Solution:** Implemented proper cleanup of socket connections and optimized event handling logic.

3. **Frontend Development**
   - **React Setup:** Set up a React application using functional components and hooks for state management.
   - **Component Design:** Built reusable components (TaskList, TaskOverview, Sidebar) to display tasks and provide an overview of task statistics.
   - **Real-Time Updates:** Utilized Socket.io-client to listen for real-time updates and dynamically update the UI.
   - **Roadblock:** Faced challenges in synchronizing state between real-time data and initial fetch results.
   - **Solution:** Managed state with React hooks, ensuring data consistency and seamless real-time updates.

## üöß Roadblocks and Solutions

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - **Problem:** Connection timeouts and inconsistent connectivity with MongoDB.
   - **Solution:** Refined the connection URI and adjusted MongoDB Atlas settings for improved reliability.

2. **Real-Time Communication Challenges**
   - **Problem:** Memory leaks and redundant re-renders due to improper handling of Socket.io events.
   - **Solution:** Properly cleaned up socket connections and optimized event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

3. **State Management Synchronization**
   - **Problem:** Difficulty synchronizing state between real-time updates and the initial fetch.
   - **Solution:** Utilized local state management strategies and carefully synchronized updates with hooks.

## üèó Work In Progress

This project is still a work in progress. Future tasks include:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Enhancing the user interface with more responsive design and accessibility features.
- Adding features for task filtering, sorting, and search functionality.
- Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and robustness.
