# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Notes
: start Backend Server first : Assuming you have set up a Node.js/Express server as your backend, you’ll need to start it first to handle the API requests and WebSocket connections.

the browser is trying to interpret an HTML file as JavaScript or JSON. This often happens when the server is not correctly serving static files or the paths to these files are incorrect.

The provided server.js script is generally well-structured, simplistic, and effective in achieving the core functionality for a task management UI dashboard. It serves static files, handles WebSocket connections for real-time updates, and manages task status updates effectively. However, there are a few improvements that can optimize and simplify the code further:

Improvements and Optimizations:
Efficient Task Updates:

Instead of emitting updates for every task every minute (even if the task's status hasn't changed), the update logic can be adjusted to emit only if a task's status actually changes. This will reduce unnecessary network traffic.
Event Cleanup:

You correctly set up interval cleanup on SIGINT. However, it's better to ensure that multiple intervals are not set up for the same connection by moving the interval setup inside the connection block.
Task Status Management:

The task status progression should be capped or handled appropriately to prevent the statuses from cycling indefinitely. Once a task reaches "Terminated," it shouldn't be updated further.
Handling Unexpected Errors:

It's a good idea to handle unexpected errors to prevent the server from crashing, which can be done by wrapping the interval logic in a try-catch block.


netstat -ano | findstr :4000

taskkill /PID (----) /F



Creating a task management UI dashboard involves several key services and components to ensure it operates effectively and provides a good user experience. Here’s a rundown of the essential services and features you might need:

1. User Authentication and Authorization
Login/Signup: Allow users to create accounts and log in.
Role Management: Different access levels (e.g., admin, user) to control who can view or edit tasks.
2. Task Management
Task Creation: Interface to create new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority, and status.
Task Editing: Ability to modify task details.
Task Deletion: Option to remove tasks.
Task Viewing: Display tasks in a list or card view, with filters and search functionality.
Task Sorting: Sorting tasks by various criteria like due date, priority, or status.
3. Task Organization
Categories/Tags: Allow tasks to be categorized or tagged for better organization.
Projects/Lists: Group tasks into projects or lists.
4. Notifications and Alerts
Due Date Reminders: Notify users when a task is approaching its due date.
Task Updates: Alert users when a task is updated or assigned to them.
5. User Interface Components
Dashboard Layout: Design a user-friendly layout that displays tasks, progress, and other relevant information.
Filters and Search: Enable users to filter and search tasks by various attributes.
Progress Tracking: Visual indicators of task progress (e.g., progress bars, completion percentage).
6. Data Management

Email Integration: Send task-related notifications and updates via email.
API Integration: Integrate with other tools or services via APIs for enhanced functionality.
8. Analytics and Reporting
Task Metrics: Track metrics like task completion rates and overdue tasks.
Reports: Generate reports on task progress, user productivity, etc.
9. Performance and Scalability
Efficient Loading: Ensure the dashboard loads quickly and efficiently.
Scalability: Handle increasing numbers of tasks and users gracefully.
10. Security
Data Encryption: Protect user data both in transit and at rest.
Access Control: Implement robust access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
11. User Feedback

Notes on server.js: 
Key Points from the Code:
Static File Serving:

The backend is set up to serve the React app's build files. This is good, but with the frontend being served by Nginx, you may not need to serve the React app from here in a Docker environment.
WebSocket for Real-Time Updates:

The WebSocket setup using socket.io is well-implemented for real-time task updates.
Task Handling:

Tasks are currently stored in memory (let tasks = [...]). For production, these should be stored in a persistent database (SQLite).
Task Status Updates:

The code simulates task status updates every minute, which is in line with your requirements.

Adjustments made to this server.js: 
    Database Integration:

Persist Tasks in SQLite: The tasks should be stored and retrieved from the SQLite database instead of in-memory storage. This ensures persistence across server restarts.
Replace the in-memory tasks array with database operations.
Remove Static File Serving:

Since Nginx is configured to serve the React app, you can remove or comment out the static file serving part from the backend if the environment is production.
Environment Variables:

Consider setting up environment variables for critical configurations, such as database paths, WebSocket settings, and more. This can be set in Docker Compose.
Docker Compatibility:

Ensure the server gracefully handles signals like SIGTERM for container shutdown.

Additional:

Explanation of the Code:
Imports and Setup:

Express is used to create the HTTP server.
Socket.io is set up for real-time WebSocket communication.
SQLite is used for persisting tasks data in a local database file.
HTTP and Path modules are used for creating the server and handling file paths.
Database Initialization:

The initDb() function sets up the SQLite database and ensures that the tasks table is created if it doesn’t already exist.
Task Handling:

The tasks are managed within an SQLite database. Functions like getTasks(), updateTaskStatus(), and addTaskToDb() interact with the database to retrieve, update, and add tasks respectively.
API Route:

The /api/tasks endpoint sends the current list of tasks to the frontend in JSON format. This is useful for initializing the task dashboard.
WebSocket Setup:

On Connection: When a client connects, they receive the current list of tasks.
Task Status Update: The server automatically updates the status of each task every minute and broadcasts these updates to all connected clients.
Add Task: New tasks can be added in real-time and are immediately saved to the database and broadcast to all clients.
Graceful Shutdown:

The server is set up to handle shutdown signals (SIGINT), ensuring that any running intervals are cleared to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
Server Start:

The server listens on the specified port (defaulting to 4000) and initializes the database before accepting connections.
Final Notes:
This server.js file is now well-commented, ensuring that anyone reviewing the code can understand the purpose of each part.
The setup is correct and aligns with the requirements of your project, including real-time updates, task persistence with SQLite, and proper handling of client connections and disconnections.

Given the requirements of the challenge, the controller should provide methods for:

Retrieving tasks.
Adding new tasks.
Updating task statuses.

Explanation:
getAllTasks:

This method handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve all tasks from the database. It interacts with the tasksService.getAllTasks() method to get the task data.
It returns the tasks as a JSON response or an error if something goes wrong.
addTask:

This method handles HTTP POST requests to add a new task. The new task's details are extracted from the request body.
It uses tasksService.addTask(newTask) to add the task and returns the newly created task as a JSON response with a 201 status code. If the operation fails, it sends a 500 status code.
updateTaskStatus:

This method handles HTTP PUT requests to update the status of an existing task. The task's ID is extracted from the request parameters, and the new status is taken from the request body.
It calls tasksService.updateTaskStatus(id, status) to perform the update.
If the task is found and updated, the updated task is sent back as a JSON response. If not, a 404 status code is returned. Errors during the process result in a 500 status code.
Next Steps:
TasksService: The tasksService.js file is where the actual business logic and database interaction will reside. It will include methods like getAllTasks, addTask, and updateTaskStatus, which the controller relies on.
Routes Setup: You would also need to set up routes in your server.js file to handle the incoming HTTP requests and direct them to the appropriate controller methods.

For the tasksService.js
Explanation:
Database Initialization (initDb):

The initDb function is used to open a connection to the SQLite database. This is done separately for each function to ensure that each operation is isolated and the database connection is properly closed after the operation is complete.
getAllTasks:

This function retrieves all tasks stored in the database using a SQL SELECT query. It returns an array of tasks, each representing a row in the tasks table.
The database connection is closed after the operation to ensure resource management.
addTask:

This function inserts a new task into the tasks table. The task details (task_name, execution_time, and status) are provided as input, while the created_at field is automatically set to the current time.
After the insertion, the function returns the full task object, including the generated id.
updateTaskStatus:

This function updates the status of an existing task in the database, identified by its id. It uses a SQL UPDATE statement to change the status.
If no rows were affected by the update (i.e., the task was not found), an error is thrown.
The function then retrieves and returns the updated task.
Integration with Other Files:
taskController.js: The tasksService.js functions are called by the controller methods (getAllTasks, addTask, updateTaskStatus). This keeps the controller lean and focused on handling HTTP requests and responses, while the service manages the actual data operations.

server.js: The taskController.js will be used in the server.js file to set up the routes for handling tasks, ensuring that requests are routed to the appropriate controller methods.

Next Steps:
Routes Setup in server.js: Ensure that the HTTP routes (/api/tasks, etc.) are correctly mapped to the corresponding methods in taskController.js.

Testing: After setting up everything, you should test the full stack to ensure tasks are being correctly created, updated, and retrieved.
