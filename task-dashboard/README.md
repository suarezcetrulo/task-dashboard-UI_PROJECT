Backend 

Under config file we have the database.js: 
The script is responsible for setting up a connection pool to a PostgreSQL database and testing the connection to ensure it is working correctly. It also exports the pool instance for use in other parts of the application.

Key Points
Connection Pooling: The script uses a connection pool (Pool) to manage multiple database connections efficiently. This approach is more efficient than creating a new connection for each query, especially in applications that make frequent database requests.
Configuration: The pool is configured with the necessary database connection details, such as username, password, host, database name, and port.
Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling for the connection test, logging any errors to the console.
Reusability: By exporting the pool instance, the script allows other modules in the application to reuse the same pool for their database operations, ensuring consistent and efficient database interaction.

taskController.js under contollers folder:

The script defines three controller functions that handle HTTP requests for managing tasks:

createTask: Creates a new task in the database.
getAllTasks: Retrieves all tasks from the database.
updateTaskStatus: Updates the status of an existing task.
Key Points
Error Handling: Each function includes error handling to manage different failure scenarios (e.g., missing parameters, invalid status values, database errors) and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
Data Validation: The updateTaskStatus function validates the status field to ensure that only valid statuses are accepted.
Database Interaction: The functions use methods from the taskModel to perform database operations, adhering to the separation of concerns principle by keeping the business logic within the controller and the data access logic within the model.
Modularization: By exporting the controller functions, the script allows for easy integration with route definitions in an Express application or similar framework, promoting modular and maintainable code.

Under the Models folder taskModels.js:

The script defines three key functions for interacting with the tasks table in a PostgreSQL database:

createTask: Inserts a new task into the database and returns the newly created task.
getAllTasks: Retrieves all tasks from the database, ordered by creation date.
updateTaskStatus: Updates the status of an existing task and conditionally sets the end date based on the status.
Key Points
Database Interaction: The functions use a connection pool to interact with the PostgreSQL database, allowing for efficient reuse of connections and reduced overhead.
SQL Queries: The functions use parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure secure database operations.
Error Handling: Errors are logged and re-thrown, allowing for centralized error management in the calling function or controller.
Modularization: The functions are organized in a model file, adhering to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern, which separates data access logic from business logic and presentation.

This script defines the routing layer for the task management API. It provides three key routes for managing tasks:

POST /tasks: To create a new task.
GET /tasks: To retrieve all tasks.
PUT /tasks/:id/status: To update the status of a specific task.
Key Points
Express Router: The use of express.Router() helps modularize the routing logic, making the application more organized and maintainable.
Separation of Concerns: The script delegates the actual request handling to controller functions (taskController.createTask, taskController.getAllTasks, taskController.updateTaskStatus), keeping the routing and business logic separate. This is in line with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern.
Parameter Handling: The route to update a taskâ€™s status demonstrates how route parameters (:id) can be used to capture dynamic values from the URL.

The script sets up an Express server for a task management application, with the following key functionalities:

JSON Parsing Middleware: Automatically parses incoming JSON requests.
Routing: Uses a separate module (tasksRoutes) to handle routes related to tasks.
Root Route: Defines a simple route at the root URL (/) to respond with a message indicating that the API is running.
Key Points
Modularity: The script imports routes from a separate module (tasksRoutes), keeping the main application file clean and focused on application-level configuration and middleware.
Middleware Usage: The express.json() middleware is used to handle JSON data, a common format for API requests.
Express Application: The script sets up and exports the Express application (app), which can be imported into another file for starting the server.
Route Prefixing: By mounting tasksRoutes on the /api path, the application follows RESTful API conventions, keeping the endpoints organized and easily manageable

Summary
This script sets up and starts an HTTP server using Express and integrates Socket.io to handle real-time WebSocket communication. The server listens on a specified port (defaulting to 3000) and handles both standard HTTP requests (using Express routes) and WebSocket connections (using Socket.io).

Key Points
HTTP Server Setup: The script sets up a standard HTTP server using Node's built-in http module and the Express application (app).
Socket.io Integration: Socket.io is integrated into the HTTP server to handle real-time, bidirectional communication. This setup allows the same server to handle both HTTP and WebSocket requests.
Event Handling: Basic event handling is set up for new connections and disconnections with Socket.io. This can be expanded to handle more complex real-time interactions, such as broadcasting messages, managing chat rooms, or updating clients with real-time data.
Port Configuration: The script uses environment variables to determine the server port, making it flexible for different environments (development, production, etc.).
